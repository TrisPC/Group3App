Group 3 Project App

Needs Android Studio or eclipse with the android sdk.

Preferably fully updated java and android sdk since ive continually been using newer functions that are available in the latest sdks as ive gone along to get swiping and back button fixed easily

At the moment it's not the most readable thing in the world but it works and is slowly getting there.

SHA1 functions and MD5 functions should work but at the moment trying to get the json parser in android to work.
